How to convert the models into OGRE.

1. Do the ligh baking (Quemado de Luces).

2. The file that has been used for doing the lightning must be saved with another name (e.g. XXXXXXXX_OgreExport.mb).

3. Assign a LAMBERT to each object.

4. In colour add BLACK, diffuse parameter 1.0. An the texture of the ligh baking add as channel "Incandescense".


Remember to add at the texture node the Filter Type in OFF.

This must be done with each object that has been used for the light baking.

Then export it with the plugin OgreMax.

5. Then at the . material, the filtering will be none, then the seams of UV will not be seen.
